# Loto3000 App üé≤

## Requirements ‚úè

A Company that has a Lottery show is planning to expand and needs a web application that will bring similar experience to a wide range of users online. Every person that thinks they have the lucky numbers can enter in numbers for the next draw. A person from the company initiates the draw, random numbers are drawn and the numbers that the people submitted until that point in time are checked if they are a winning combination. Winners should be added in a separate board where they can be accessed by anyone. All of these functionalities need to be accessible by any device so that the players can play on a different variety of devices. 
> The client side of the application will be handled by other development teams.
> There is no need for payment implementation. The payment will be handled by a third party service.

## Key Logic ‚úè

* User - A player that is  able to play the game
* Admin - A company employee that can initiate a draw
* Draw - The process of drawing the numbers, finding winners and starting the next session
* Session - The time between the last and next draw
* Prize - A prize for winning a combination
