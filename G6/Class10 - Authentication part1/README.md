# Securing API communication ðŸš“

Securing API applications can be tricky. Unlike MVC applications where there is more control of what the user sees and can interact with, web APIs have no knowledge of what or where the client is or what is planning to do with our data. This is why communication between the client and server should be made secure.

## Authentication and Authorization ðŸ”¸

Authentication and Authorization are key principles in securing any application. They have different meanings and they happen a different points in the security cycle.

* Authentication - The process where we identify and verify a user or process that is trying to access the application. We always do authentication before authorization.
* Authorization - The process where we give permission to the user or process on what and where they can access the application. This process is done after authentication because we need to know who the user is before we can grant them access to the features of our application.

## Securing API applications ðŸ”¸

Securing API applications is done through implementing security measures on the application itself as well as on the requests that are used for communication with the client. There should also be a focus on the client experience and usability. There are multiple systems for managing security as well as accessibility to the client. Some of the most used ones are:

* Session based
* Token based

### Sessions ( Stateful ) ðŸ”½

Working with sessions is one way of authenticating a source of requests and keeping that connection secure. This method works by the server creating sessions for every client that requests something from it. These sessions are kept on the server machine. Every time a client requests something, they are authenticated, and then they are given a cookie with a session id which represents their session id on the server along with a signature unique to the server called a secret that makes the cookie authentic and serves as a protection from the client changing the cookie. This method works as follows:

1. User submits login credentials ( username, pass )
2. Server verifies those from the DB
3. Server creates a temporary user session
4. Server issues a cookie with a session ID
5. User sends the cookie with each request
6. Server validates against the stored session and grants access
7. When the user logs out it destroys the session and clears the cookie

This system is also called stateful because we keep sessions on the server as well as keep data on the client ( id ).

### Tokens ( Stateless ) ðŸ”½

Tokens are another way to secure communication between client and server. This system involves a special string called a token to be passed to the client on successful authentication. This token then can be passed with every request to get authenticated with the server. Tokens are not kept by the server. They usually carry data with them as well as a signature and a secret that only the server knows. All of this information is transformed into a string, some parts are encrypted and it is given to the client. This way everything needed is in the cookie and the server does not need to keep data on its side. The cookie is the data and the key to authorized requests. The flow of this system goes:

1. User submits login credentials ( username, pass )
2. Server verifies those from the DB
3. Server generates a temporary token and embeds user data into it
4. Server responds back with the token
5. Client stores it ( local storage )
6. User sends the token with each request
7. Server verifies the token and grants access
8. On Log-out the token is cleared from client storage

Communication secured by the token is usually called stateless and self-contained. This means that the server does not keep any data on the state of the client. It also means that all necessary data is on the token itself.

## JWT bearer token ðŸ”¸

A JWT or JSON Web Token is a json that follows certain rules, is digitally signed, and is used for securely exchanging information between client and server. JWT Tokens can be signed digitally by a secret that only the server knows or with public/private key pairs. The JWT token has a defined structure consisting of 3 parts:

* Header - Data about the token itself ( Encoded in Base64Url )
  * alg - Algorithm used for signing hash ( "SHA256" )
  * typ - Type of cookie ( "JWT" )
* Payload - Statements for our business logic called claims ( Encoded in Base64Url )
  * iss - the issuer of the token ( Who is issuing the token )
  * exp - what time does the token expire
  * sub - subject of the token ( Some data that is important for the business logic )
  * aud - audience of the token ( Who is the token meant for )
* Signature - a unique signature hashed with encryption written in the header. The input data that is hashed is the header, payload and a secret ( a string that only the server knows )

### Hashing ðŸ”½

The process of converting input from a different length to a fixed set of numbers or text of the same length ( by mathematical algorithm ). This process creates a string that is totally different from the string it started. This makes the string useless unless compared with a hash that came from the same string. Hashing is used for various purposes, mostly for the verification of things such as addresses, passwords, file names, etc. The hashing process goes like this:

1. **Input**: a string of any length is selected
2. **Hash Method**: A method that executes a mathematical algorithm is selected that will convert the string into a fixed set of string characters or numbers ( MD5, SHA256, etc. )
3. **Hash**: The hash method returns a new string or set of numbers that are called a hash

#### Hashing a password

```csharp asp
...
... input username and password
...
// We create an instance of the MD5CryptoServiceProvider that will help us create the hash
var md5 = new MD5CryptoServiceProvider();
// We create the hash from the password
var md5Data = md5.ComputeHash(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(password));
// We get the hash string
var hashedPassword = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(md5Data);
// We look for a user with username and password ( hash )
var user = _userRepository.GetAll().SingleOrDefault(x => x.Username == username && x.Password == hashedPassword);
// If no user is available return null
if (user == null)
    return null;
```

### How do JWT tokens work ðŸ”½

When a Client requests something from a server the server validates the request ( Ex: username and password ) After that the server creates a token by adding the header, adding some claims about the user that is relevant for when the token is returned back ( Ex: Username and UserId ). Then it combines them with the secret and creates a hash with the preferred algorithm. It combines everything and creates the JWT string. The token is returned to the client. The client decides how to keep the token. On every other call, the client will just give the token to the server. The token will validate the token to see if it has been changed or tampered with. If it is valid it will allow the client's request. The token can be invalidated by trying to change it or if the token is expired.

### How to use JWT tokens in an ASP.NET Core WebAPI application ðŸ”½

ASP.NET Core applications have an internal system for authentication. The authentication of our application should be configured and after that, we can add attributes on the controllers or actions to use authentication. ASP.NET Core supports authentication via JWT tokens. This means that there are already functions and classes that support working with tokens like these that make development more quick and easy.

#### Configuration ( Program.cs )

```csharp asp
 ...
 ...
// Configuring AppSettings section
var appConfig = builder.Configuration.GetSection("AppSettings");
builder.Services.Configure<AppSettings>(appConfig);

// Using AppSettings
var appSettings = appConfig.Get<AppSettings>();
var secret = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(appSettings.Secret);

builder.Services.AddAuthentication(x =>
{
    x.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
    x.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
}
).AddJwtBearer(x =>
{
    x.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
    x.SaveToken = true;
    x.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
    {
        ValidateIssuerSigningKey = true,
        IssuerSigningKey = new SymmetricSecurityKey(secret),
        ValidateIssuer = false,
        ValidateAudience = false
    };
}
);

// The order must always be authentication and then authorization here
app.UseAuthentication();
app.UseAuthorization();

 ...
 ...
```

#### Usage ( Creating a token for a user )

```csharp asp
// We create an instance of JwtSecurityTokenHandler that lets us create and validate JWT tokens
var tokenHandler = new JwtSecurityTokenHandler();
// Since all methods for security and algorithms work with byte[] we convert the secret into one ( the secret is added as a configuration string )
var key = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(_config.Secret);
// All data we need to create the token is set here
var tokenDescriptor = new SecurityTokenDescriptor
{
    // Claims ( name and id )
    Subject = new ClaimsIdentity(new[]
    {
        new Claim(ClaimTypes.Name, $"{user.FirstName} {user.LastName}"),
        new Claim(ClaimTypes.NameIdentifier, user.Id.ToString())
    }),
    // Time when the token will expire and it will need to be refreshed
    Expires = DateTime.UtcNow.AddDays(7),
    // Incorporating the secret in the signiture hashed with the SHA256 algorithm
    SigningCredentials = new SigningCredentials(new SymmetricSecurityKey(key), SecurityAlgorithms.HmacSha256Signature)
};
// We create a new token with the description that we created
var token = tokenHandler.CreateToken(tokenDescriptor);
// We return a user model, with the user data as well as the token
var userModel = new UserModel()
{
    Id = user.Id,
    FirstName = user.FirstName,
    LastName = user.LastName,
    Username = user.Username,
    Token = tokenHandler.WriteToken(token) // Converting from SecurityToken object to string
};
return userModel
```

#### Authorization attributes

* **[AllowAnonymous]** - Allows unauthorized requests

```csharp asp
[AllowAnonymous]
[HttpPost("authenticate")]
public IActionResult Authenticate([FromBody] LoginModel model)
{
    var user = _userService.Authenticate(model.Username, model.Password);

    if (user == null)
 return NotFound("Username or password is incorrect");

    return Ok(user);
}
```

* **[Authorize]** - Authorizes all requests via configured authorization method

```csharp asp
[Authorize]
[HttpGet]
public ActionResult<IEnumerable<NoteModel>> Get()
{
    var userId = GetAuthorizedUserId();

    return Ok(_toDoItemService.GetUserNotes(userId));
}
```

## OAuth 2.0 ðŸ”¸

The number of devices and services that we use is growing and every device and service requires authorization. This is why authorization frameworks such as OAuth 2.0 exist. With it, our application or service can obtain limited access to a user account that is enough to authenticate it from another system such as Facebook, Google, Github, etc. This is the framework that gives the option to sign in with a Facebook/Google account instead of creating an account or logging in. In order for an application to have access to this type of authorization from another system, it needs to be registered on that system. After registering the system gives the application a unique ID and a secret that will identify that application when making requests. The flow of OAuth authentication usually goes like this:

1. A user clicks to authorize through another service ( ex: google )
2. Google will show an authorization screen to enter username/password ( usually this is an authorization API )
3. When the user enters the correct data it grants permission to the application and the application gets an access token
4. The application then requests the user data that the user agreed to share ( usually a different resource API )
5. The server validates the access token and gives the application the requested data
6. The application then authorizes the user ( ex: with their google account )
